# Multi-Domain Recommender System
In today's dynamic and information-rich landscape, users often grapple with the 
challenge of navigating through an overwhelming array of choices, struggling to 
find content that aligns with their individual preferences and interests. Recommender systems emerge as a pivotal solution to alleviate this dilemma by 
offering tailored suggestions
## Problem Statement
- Information Overload and Decision Fatigue:
    - The abundance of options can cause decision paralysis, making it harder for users to find relevant content. This process can also be time-consuming and stressful.

- Generic Recommendations:
   - Existing recommendation systems on platforms also sometimes tend to offer generic and common items that are not tailored to user's preferences. Although this diversity in recommendations is good, it could be frustrating sometimes.
- Single domain focus:
    - Existing recommendation systems only recommends items of their domain (and rightfully so!). But there is a need for a unified, multi-domain recommender system that provides personalized suggestions on a single platform. 
      This could be transformed into a social media platform where users interact and recommend each other stuff,sort of like letterboxd but for multiple domains, but that's for another project !
